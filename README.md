# Rick and Morty Teams

This was created during an API challenge late on in the _nology course. The data fetched from a Rick and Morty API and displayed on cards, I then added an extra element of being able to choose a team by logging in with firebase-auth.

## Key features

- React JSX
- Firebase
- API
- Reach-Router
- SCSS
