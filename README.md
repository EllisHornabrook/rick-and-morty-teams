# Rick and Morty Teams

This was created during an API challenge late on in the _nology course. I fetched the data from a Rick and Morty API and displayed them on cards, I then added the extra element of being able to choosing a team by logging in with firebase-auth.

## Key features

- React JSX
- Firebase
- API
- Reach-Router
- SCSS
